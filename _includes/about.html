<h1>About Love N Revenge</h1>

<p>
With two Successful International Album Releases under my belt with my project Rockarma, my brainchild is born... DAMON KELLY "LOVE N' REVENGE" released globally headlining the 2013 PSW Emmy Awards on June 15, 2013 in Las Vegas, NV. The past few years has brought many golden opportunities working with many staples in our Melodic Rock Community to opportunities in tv/film as a composer and an actor as well as charity work we love to be a part of.

From growing up on the farm in Saskatchewan, Canada to touring internationally to living in Los Angeles/Hollywood area the past couple years puts the biggest smile on my face and in my heart on a daily basis knowing the power of my music is going to help someone or touch somebodys life in a certain way. That's what we are about as songwriters and artists. Our passion, drive, professionalism and undying determination to be one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all time is second to none, and absolutely nothing will stop me and my team.  I am truly blessed and have a monsoon of respect for the incredibly talented songwriters and artists that made me who i am today as i am influenced by many, Melodic Arena Rock is the blood that runs through my veins. My music will clearly define my biggest influences as we are cut from the same cloth. I have initiated my Karma Foundation approx 3 years ago to help sick kids and kids with wishes bringing many charitable events we love to be a part of. It was at that time i discovered The Karma Foundation in Los Angeles, that i have been a member of for the past few years and the fantastic people i have met and just what The Karma Foundation stands for and believes in absolutely melts with what our team is all about. Music is a healing power, a monsoon of strength to shed a tear, a shiver down the spine, and simply to put a smile on anyones face to give hope and a better day...Our entourage involves the best of the best musicians, tatoo & airbrush artists, pyrotechnics, management, celebrity publicity experts, etc... not to mention a kikass rock n roll extravaganza.. we all have lived and tasted the REAL music world, and now its our turn to change the hands of time with the Resurrection of Melodic Arena Rock with an extremely powerful live show, to the intimate and interactive acoustic performance... we truly believe in what who we are and what we do, and it is our mission to share globally, all in the name of rock n' roll.

With so many cool things in the works on for our team, we are making Los Angeles/Hollywood our permanent home as of Sept 2013, and are globally declaring a generous donation off of every album and download sold to be donated to the KARMA FOUNDATION to make a difference, as well as very much want to be a part of any and many events to complete our common goal. That is what completes us. "LOVE N' REVENGE" is exactly what it is, a story that anyone can relate to through my music. It is now time to take this ocean of happiness, tears, heart, and pain out on the road in the form of Pure Guitar Driven Melodic Arena Rock. The words have been spoken, the story has been told.
